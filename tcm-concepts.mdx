## Overview

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) rests on ancient philosophies that explain health, disease, and the universe. You encounter these core concepts—Yin and Yang, Five Elements, Qi, meridians, and energy flow—throughout TCM practices. They form the foundation for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Grasping them empowers you to appreciate TCM's holistic approach.

## Yin and Yang Theory

Yin and Yang represent complementary opposites: Yin as cool, passive, and feminine; Yang as warm, active, and masculine. You maintain health by balancing them. Excess Yin causes cold conditions; excess Yang leads to heat.

## Five Elements Framework

The Five Elements—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water—interact through generating and controlling cycles. You use this to diagnose organ relationships.

| Element | Organs          | Emotion | Season |
|---------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Wood    | Liver, Gallbladder | Anger  | Spring |
| Fire    | Heart, Small Intestine | Joy   | Summer |
| Earth   | Spleen, Stomach | Worry  | Late Summer |
| Metal   | Lungs, Large Intestine | Grief | Autumn |
| Water   | Kidneys, Bladder | Fear  | Winter |

<Callout kind="tip">
  Trace symptoms: Liver (Wood) issues may weaken Lungs (Metal) via controlling cycle.

## Qi, Meridians, and Energy Flow

Qi is your vital life force flowing through 12 main meridians—pathways connecting organs. Blockages disrupt health; you clear them via acupuncture or herbs.
